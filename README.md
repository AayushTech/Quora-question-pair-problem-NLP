# Quora-question-pair-problem-NLP
Quora is a QnA platform Over 100 million people visit Quora every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question. In this project we will take help of NLP and ML to analyse whether a question is new or already was asked before
